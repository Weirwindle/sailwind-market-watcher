💡 **Development** This project is written in Python using:

- `tkinter` for the GUI
- `pymem` for memory access
- `Pillow` for image icons

---

🧠 **How It Works**

- Uses `pymem` to attach to the running `Sailwind.exe` process
- Scans for a known byte pattern to locate in-game market objects
- Reads each market’s name, product list, and supply value directly from memory
- Applies the game’s pricing formula to calculate sell/buy values dynamically:

```python
def calc_sell_price(supply, V):
    coeff = 0.38 if supply > 0.5 else -1.68
    return ceil((coeff * V / 10000) * (supply ** 2) - (abs(coeff) * V / 50) * supply + V)
```

- Builds a table of trade routes, ranked by total and per-item profit

---

💱 **Currency Conversion** The game uses different currencies in different regions (Lions, Dragons, Crowns, etc). To calculate trades properly:

1. Visit a Currency Exchange port in the game
2. Use the posted exchange rate to convert to Lions
3. Enter that value into the app’s Conversion Rate field

💡 Estimated values shown in the app:

```
Lions ≈ 34.0
Dragons ≈ 330
Crowns ≈ 82.0
```

Use the actual in-game rate when possible for best results.
