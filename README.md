🧠 **How It Works**
This app reads Sailwind’s memory using pymem, scanning for a known pattern of market objects. 
It interprets product supplies and calculates dynamic prices using the game’s internal pricing formula.
It does not modify game memory or change game behavior.

💱 **Currency Conversion**
The game uses different currencies in different regions (Lions, Dragons, Crowns, etc).
To calculate trades properly:
1. Visit a Currency Exchange port in the game
2. Use the posted exchange rate to convert to Lions
3. Enter that value into the app’s Conversion Rate field

💡 Estimated values shown in the app:
    Lions ≈ 34.0
    Dragons ≈ 330
    Crowns ≈ 82.0
Use the actual in-game rate when possible for best results.
